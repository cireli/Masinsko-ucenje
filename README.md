# Modelling vehicle type output based on given silhouettes by using Python Machine Learning Libraries
Project made for Faculty's Artificial Intelligence class.

## The task
The goal of the task was the analysis of a data set that describes vehicle silhouettes and the application of several different machine learning models to classify vehicles based on those silhouettes

## Data analysis
